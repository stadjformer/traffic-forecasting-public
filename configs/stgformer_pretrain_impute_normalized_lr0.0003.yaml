# STGFormer with Masked Node Pretraining + Imputation on Normalized Data + Lower Fine-tuning LR
#
# Same as stgformer_pretrain_impute_normalized.yaml but with LOWER learning rate
# for fine-tuning (0.0003 vs 0.001).
#
# Rationale: Pretrained weights are already good, so use smaller steps to avoid
# destroying learned representations and reduce validation oscillations.
#
# Key differences from stgformer_pretrain_impute_normalized.yaml:
#   - training.learning_rate: 0.0003 (3x lower for stable fine-tuning)
#   - Different HF repo prefix
#
# Usage:
#   python scripts/train_stgformer.py --config configs/stgformer_pretrain_impute_normalized_lr0.0003.yaml
